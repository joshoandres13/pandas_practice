# Powerlifting Database

## About Dataset
### Context
This dataset is a snapshot of the OpenPowerlifting database as of April 2019. OpenPowerlifting is creating a public-domain archive of powerlifting history. Powerlifting is a sport in which competitors compete to lift the most weight for their class in three separate barbell lifts: the Squat, Bench, and Deadlift.

### Content
The data is represented by openpowerlifting.csv, which includes all information on the meets (competitions) as well as the competitors who attended those meets.

Version 1 of this dataset included two files: meets.csv and openpowerlifting.csv. meets.csv is a record of all meets (competitions) included in the OpenPowerlifting database. openpowerlifting.csv is a record of all competitors who attended those meets, and the stats and lifts that they recorded at them.

In Version 2+, meets.csv has been subsumed by openpowerlifting.csv, which contains the same information.

For more on how this dataset was collected, see the OpenPowerlifting FAQ.
